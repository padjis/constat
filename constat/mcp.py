"""The MCP server: Constat as a service an agent can drive (D-045).

Four tools, and the shape of that list is the governance model.

**What is exposed.** Gathering evidence, reading the payload, submitting a
reading, and listing the review queue — the two halves of the loop plus the
two read-only views. All of it is work an agent can usefully do.

**What is deliberately absent: acceptance.** There is no `accept` tool and no
`reject` tool. A model that could call `accept` would make "no proposal becomes
official without an explicit human decision" unenforceable, and the hard
prohibition in `CLAUDE.md` is that Constat must never mark a proposal approved
without a recorded human decision. Acceptance stays a human act at the CLI,
outside the agent's reach. That absence is tested, because a later release
adding one tool "for convenience" is exactly how this gets lost.

**Transport is stdio.** The client spawns Constat as a subprocess; nothing
listens on a port. That is what keeps this a local tool rather than the hosted
service `PRODUCT_SPEC.md` § 6.2 defers, and it means no authentication layer
is needed — which § 6.2 also defers.

**Every tool goes through the same code as the CLI.** No tool reimplements an
operation, so the gates hold here by construction: identity never crosses the
boundary (D-040), the credential gate fires on export (D-047), and a submitted
reading is grounded against re-gathered evidence (D-052).

**One precondition was removed rather than a tool added** (CON-64, D-063).
`gather_evidence` opens a ticket it does not find, because the loop above
cannot start otherwise and nothing here said so. The tool list is unchanged by
it — which is the argument for it. A reference matching no commits anywhere is
still refused, so the refusal it replaced survives where it was doing work.

Constat turns software changes into evidence-backed, human-approved knowledge.

The loop: gather_evidence collects what a ticket changed across the registered
repositories, opening the ticket if it is new; get_payload returns that
evidence, redacted, together with the rules already in the catalogue; you read
it and submit_rules stores what you concluded as rule proposals;
list_rule_proposals shows what is awaiting review.

Start with gather_evidence whether or not the ticket exists. A reference no
repository knows is refused rather than opened, so a refusal there means the
reference is wrong — report it rather than retrying.

Nothing you submit is accepted. Every rule proposal waits for a human decision
at the command line, and there is no tool here that can make one. Anchors must
name paths present in the evidence supplied — a rule proposal anchored to
anything else is discarded, and you will be told why.
