"""Storing rule proposals and the decisions on them.

A rule proposal is a **dated, attributed reading of the evidence one run
gathered** (D-046, D-048) — a rule in a pre-acceptance state, not a separate
kind of object. Three properties follow, and all three are enforced by the
database rather than by this module:

**A reading is never edited.** `rule_proposal` aborts `UPDATE` and `DELETE`. A
later run makes a new reading; "current" is derived, never stored. Editing one
would rewrite what a reviewer was shown, and deleting one would erase that it
was ever offered — the same loss D-046 refuses for discarded readings.

**A decision does not mutate the reading.** It goes in its own append-only
table, the shape `document_version` uses for documents (CON-31). `rejected`
means inconclusive rather than wrong (D-036), so a later reading of better
evidence is expected rather than precluded.

**`revises_rule_id` is a claim, not a key.** Anchors find candidates; the
interpretation pass decides which rule a reading revises (D-050). A wrong claim
is a rejectable interpretation, not a corrupted identity.
