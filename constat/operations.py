"""Operations: gathering evidence for a ticket across the registered set.

An operation reads every registered repository, resolves the ticket's commit
set (D-030, D-031), collects bounded evidence for it, and expands the ticket's
document. Each run is recorded — what ran, against which repository, when, and
what it contributed — because a document whose contents cannot be attributed
is the failure this product exists to prevent (D-029).

**Evidence is collected per commit, not as one cumulative diff.** A ticket's
commits need not be contiguous, so there is no single revision range that
means "this ticket's effect". Diffing the first commit's parent against the
last would sweep in whatever else landed between them. Per-commit collection
costs some duplication — a file touched three times appears three times — but
each hunk stays attributable to the commit that made it, which is the whole
point of provenance (product rule 3).
