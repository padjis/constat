"""The interpretation layer.

Isolated behind a provider interface (D-003). The evidence pipeline has no
dependency on anything in here: with no provider configured the whole
workflow runs, reports evidence, and states that no rules were identified
rather than implying none exist (D-039).

Everything a provider is given passes through `redaction` first, which is
where the personal-data question deferred at D-023 is settled.
