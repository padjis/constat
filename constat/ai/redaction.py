"""The privacy boundary: evidence in, provider payload out.

Settles the question deferred at D-023. Collected evidence carries author and
committer names, email addresses and timestamps. That is harmless while it
stays on the machine that produced it, and it is a personal-data disclosure
the moment it is sent to a third party, so product rule 7 (least privilege)
decides it: **identity does not cross this boundary at all.**

Rule generation needs to know *what* changed. It never needs to know *who*
changed it. There is therefore no reason for a name, an address or a date to
be in the payload, and the cheapest way to guarantee they are not is to build
a separate type that has nowhere to put them.

Two things make this more than a field-copying exercise:

- **Free text leaks identity.** A commit body carries `Signed-off-by:` and
  `Co-Authored-By:` trailers, and people write addresses into messages. Those
  are removed from messages rather than trusted to be absent.
- **Diffs leak identity too.** A changed `AUTHORS`, mailmap or contributor
  list puts addresses in the diff text itself. Addresses are masked there, but
  lines are never dropped: removing a line from a diff would misrepresent the
  change, and this module must not trade one kind of dishonesty for another.

The payload types are deliberately constructible only by going through
`redact`. If a caller could assemble one by hand, sooner or later one will,
with the author field it happened to have to hand.
