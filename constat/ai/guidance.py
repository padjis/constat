"""What a good rule proposal looks like, in one place (CON-66).

Two paths ask a model to read evidence and propose business rules: the
provider (`providers/anthropic.py`, through `SYSTEM`) and an agent driving the
MCP server (`mcp.py`, through a prompt). Both need the same guidance, and
there is no version of this project where they should differ — a rule proposed
over MCP and the same rule proposed by a provider must mean the same thing, or
the catalogue becomes a record of which path happened to be configured.

So the guidance lives here and both import it. The alternative, two prose
blocks maintained in parallel, is the kind of duplication that reads as
harmless right up until one of them is improved.

Nothing here is a prompt by itself. Each caller wraps it in whatever its own
surface needs — a system message, a user turn — because those shapes differ
even when the content must not.

WHAT_A_RULE_IS = """\
A business rule is something a person in the business could agree or disagree \
with, stated without reference to code. "A transfer above the daily limit is \
refused" is a rule. "The LIMIT constant changed from 100 to 250" is not — it \
is a description of a diff, and restating the diff is the most common way to \
get this wrong.

Identify only rules the evidence supports. Returning no rules is a correct \
answer when a change carries no business meaning: a refactor, a dependency \
bump, a formatting pass. No rules is far better than a plausible guess, \
because every proposal costs a person a decision.\
"""

ANCHORS = """\
Every anchor must name a path that appears in the evidence you were given. An \
anchor says where a rule lives, not that its behaviour changed — whether the \
behaviour changed is for a reviewer to say. A proposal anchored to a path \
nobody sent is discarded with a reason, so inventing one wastes the run.\
"""

REVISION = """\
You are shown the rules already in the catalogue. If what you identify is a \
revision of one of them, name its id in `revises` rather than proposing it \
again — that appends a new version instead of duplicating the rule.\
"""

PENDING = """\
You are also shown this ticket's review queue: readings already submitted that \
nobody has decided yet. If one of them already says what you would say, do not \
say it again — a second identical proposal costs a person a second decision for \
one rule, and `revises` cannot be used for it because a pending proposal is not \
yet a rule. Propose only what the queue does not already cover.\
"""

NOTHING_IS_ACCEPTED = """\
Nothing you propose is accepted. Every proposal waits for a person to decide \
at the command line, and there is no tool, flag or setting that can decide for \
them. Do not describe a proposal as approved, adopted or confirmed.\
