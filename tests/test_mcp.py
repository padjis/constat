"""Tests for the MCP server (CON-50).

The most important test here asserts an **absence**: there is no tool that can
accept a rule proposal. A model that could accept would make "no proposal
becomes official without an explicit human decision" unenforceable, and the
hard prohibition in `CLAUDE.md` is that Constat must never mark a proposal
approved without a recorded human decision.

An absence is the easiest thing to lose. A later release adding one tool "for
convenience" would do it silently, so the tool list is asserted rather than
trusted.

The rest check that the gates hold through this door too — identity (D-040),
the credential refusal (D-047) and anchor grounding (D-052) — which they do by
construction, because every tool calls the same function the CLI does.
